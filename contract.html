            &nbsp;At a minimum, Independent Contractor will pay $500 per year to the Giddy Digs. In the event that

            automatically deducted from any payment received by the Giddy Digs prior to Independent Contractor
            receiving compensation. &nbsp;At a minimum, Independent Contractor will pay $500 per year to the Giddy

    <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Regardless of which compensation structure is selected, Independent Contractor
            will pay $100 per transaction. This fee applies even when Independent Contractor selects a compensation
            structure including a cap (Option 4). &nbsp;This fee will be deducted from every transaction prior to
            the Independent Contractor receiving compensation. </span></p>
